# Java Login Signup Demo

This is a simple Java Spring Boot project demonstrating user signup, login, and a dashboard with in-memory user storage (no database).

## Features
- User signup with username and password
- User login validation
- Simple user dashboard showing registered users
- Thymeleaf for server-side templates
- Basic CSS for styling

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the Spring Boot application.
3. Access the signup page at `http://localhost:8080/users/signup`
4. Login at `http://localhost:8080/users/login`

## Note
This project uses an in-memory list to store users, so all data is lost on application restart.
